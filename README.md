# Image classification
MNIST handwritten digit recognition with keras and TF backend

### Prerequisites
check out requirements.txt or just run tha below code in a virtual env
```
pip install requirements.txt

```
## Getting Started
```
python app.py 

```
Goto http://localhost:5000


## Built With

* [Keras](https://keras.io) - The Neural Network high level API
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - Backend for Keras
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - Backend framework used to serve model


## Deployment
Check out Heroku or this video 
* [Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmRT8QQLIqk) - Gives u basic idea on how to deploy

### Note
I just wanted to try out combining Keras and flask whether it would work. So i didnt train model at all Since i used CNN it learns faster and better than normal ANN . I used a simple network ,you can try out pre trained models for better performance
